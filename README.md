# Categorize by Features (ArcGIS 10.4.1)

Categorizes Target Features based on the spatial geometry and a specified field of Category Features.  This capability allows for the categorization of a feature class through division and categorization of feature geometry while maintaining a consolidated file structure.  This method provides an alternative to spatial definition queries where the latter is infeasible.

The provided ArcToolbox includes multiple tools for feature categorization, including for workspace designation (both in memory and on disk), dual categorization, and forced source metadata cloning.

For use, place the .tbx file and the "Python_Scripts" folder in the same directory and access with ArcGIS 10.4.1+.
